The original folder contains the original kerenls for each benchmark.
The other folders contain the refactored, HLS-safe code for each approach.
The results for this paper are found under the RecRel_RecElim folder.

Each test has its own folder. 
The header.hpp and test.cpp don't change and are only used for the HLS process.
The prog.cpp contains all the produced code.
